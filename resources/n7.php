      <p>The disclosure was made in response to a written parliamentary question submitted by Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour’s shadow international trade secretary.

        He told the Telegraph: It is so frustrating for me to see the failure of government in trade. We have just passed the end of 2022. This was the time when 80% of our trade was to be covered by free trade agreements according to the Conservative manifesto of 2019.</p>
      <p>We did not succeed, we failed. It was the time of delivery of the failed US deal. And of course there was that extra promise of an India deal by Diwali, which had been promised by Boris Johnson, which also failed to materialize.</p>
      <p>Mr Thomas-Symonds was speaking on Monday ahead of a summit where the Labor Party is hosting 100 ambassadors, diplomats and high commissioners, including from the US, Canada, France and Germany, as well as more than 200 heads of business.</p>
      <p>Our big message is that Labor is back in business; Labor is open for business, he said. We are pro-business, we are pro-trade.


        He accused the ministers of having reached no agreements or bad agreements since leaving the European Union.</p>
      <p>But Mr Thomas-Symonds said a Labor government would nonetheless honor all existing trade deals if it comes to power in the next election.

        The trade agreements that I inherit, I will exploit them, develop them and try to help exporters to exploit the opportunities, he said. We have to do this because when we give our word as a country, we have to stick to it. I think it’s really, really important for stability.</p>
      <p>Rishi Sunak has played down the prospect of a US trade deal in the near future, admitting he did not discuss any bilateral trade deal when he first met with Mr Biden at the G20 summit in November.</p>
      <p>Mr Sunak said he was filled with optimism about the relationship but suggested it could take years for any formal agreement.

        Meanwhile, a senior US Congress official has warned that while a bilateral trade deal between the US and UK is desirable, it will not progress until the issues surrounding the Northern Ireland Protocol are resolved. not resolved.</p>
