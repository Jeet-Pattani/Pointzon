      <p>Hannah Lewis was seven when she watched a Nazi death squad execute her mother.

        Her family was rounded up by Hitler's troops and forced to march to a labour camp in the Polish village of Adampol in 1943.</p>
      <p>Hannah's father, Adam, escaped from the camp to join the partisans, a Jewish resistance movement during the Second World War, and returned to warn of an imminent Nazi raid, the night before his wife's death.

        Hannah's mother, Haya, refused to flee, fearing her daughter, who had fallen ill with a high temperature and suspected typhoid, would not survive.</p>
      <p>"For as long as I live, I will always wonder how she got through that night," Hannah told Sky's Sophy Ridge.

        "How she made the decision she made? Was it right?"

        The next morning, Hannah heard "yelling" and "screaming" after the arrival of the Einsatzgruppen, the Nazis' mobile killing unit responsible for the mass shooting of Jews.</p>
      <p>"Suddenly there was a whack on the door and my mother - with great dignity - got on her knees, took me in her arms, and gave me a hug and a kiss," Hannah said.

        "She didn't run, she didn't make a sound. She walked to the door, opened the door and closed it firmly behind her.</p>

      <p>
        "I waited for her to come back... but she didn't come back."
      </p>
