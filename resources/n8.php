      <p>Disgraced former Minister Keith Vaz has dismissed claims he plans to run again for MP for Leicester East after Labor officials introduced new controls over candidate selection processes in the city.</p>
      <p>Amid mounting speculation that the former head of the Special Committee on Home Affairs is poised to make a comeback following the harassment conviction of incumbent MP Claudia Webbe, he told the Guardian: “This ship has sailed.”

        Last week Labor introduced rules for the city’s constituencies to allow the party’s governing national body to select candidates for council rather than leave the decision to local members.</p>
      <p>The move has sparked fury among Labor’s 49 councillors, 37 of whom have signed a document calling for the proposals to be withdrawn urgently because they are undemocratic. But the move has also been hailed by some local campaigners as the first step in wresting control of the Leicester East Labor Party from Vaz, who represented the constituency for 32 years.</p>
      <p>Vaz resigned as a contestant in 2019 after being caught in a tabloid dealing with acquiring cocaine for sex workers and after being found guilty of bullying employees.

        Webbe was elected that year but suspended from the party after a court ruled that she had molested another woman. Webbe maintains her innocence and appeals against the party verdict.</p>

      <p>Several constituency sources said Vaz remained in control of the constituency and worked closely with a cadre of councillors. They claim he can still try to run for parliament again or choose another candidate for the next general election.

        In a rare public statement since stepping down, Vaz has hinted that he will no longer stand. “I’m happy to say the ship sailed — a few years ago,” he said in a text message.</p>
      <p>Senior party officials said Vaz’s increasing influence in Leicester East, where he remains Honorary President, has become a problem as they prepare to select the next parliamentary candidate.

        An email sent by regional director Richard Oliver to three constituency parties – Leicester East, West and South – said the party had decided to tear up existing plans to allow constituencies to pick their own council candidates.</p>
      <p>It said: “The Campaign Improvement Board had a number of concerns about the process and has requested that an NEC panel be convened to interview and select all candidates across the city. This recommendation was accepted by the NEC.”
