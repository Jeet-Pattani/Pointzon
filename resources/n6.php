<p>Bill Turnbull's warmth as a breakfast show host woke us up each morning. His diagnosis woke up Britain to prostate cancer. And his death sparked an outpouring of love and the biggest ever spike of people checking their risk in a single day.</p>
<p>The much-loved BBC Breakfast broadcaster and journalist inspired millions with his warmth, humour and easy charm. And since he shared the news of his diagnosis in 2018, he pushed prostate cancer up the agenda and saved countless lives.</p>
<p>Now his daughter is continuing that legacy. In his memory, his daughter Flora will run the London Marathon to raise money to save men's lives. A challenge the great man himself took on, no fewer than five times.</p>
<p>On Flora's fundraising page she says, "My dad ran the London marathon five times during his life and I am hugely honoured to be able to run it in his memory. He will be with me every step of the way. I want to ensure that everyone can keep their dads, partners, brothers, sons, grandads, uncles and friends around for as long as possible</p>
