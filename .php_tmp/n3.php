      <p>A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 15-year-old girl was fatally stabbed in the Priestpopple area of Hexham, Northumbria police said.</p>
      <p>The force said the ambulance service alerted officers shortly after 5.10pm on Friday to a report of a teenage boy and girl who had been injured in a suspected assault.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended the scene, where the teenagers were found to have suffered injuries consistent with having been caused by a bladed article, police said.</p>
      <p>Northumbria police tweeted: “They were both taken to hospital, with the girl’s injuries described as life-threatening.</p>
      <p>“Sadly, despite best efforts of hospital staff, the girl passed away later that evening. The boy suffered serious, non-life-threatening injuries and remains in hospital. Both of their families are being supported by specially trained officers at this devastating time.”

        A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of assault, and later on suspicion of murder. He remains in police custody.</p>
